# GNU Radio FM Lesson Receiver Flows

Modernized GNU Radio lesson flowgraphs for FM receiver practice and solution comparison.

FM receiver starter and solution graphs using osmocom source and audio output. The repository is modern-only: runnable GNU Radio Companion files live in `modern/`, use repo-local paths, and validate with GNU Radio Companion 3.8.5.0.

## Features

- Modern GNU Radio Companion XML only; outdated source XML was removed from the public repo.
- Qt GUI blocks replace old WX GUI patterns where applicable.
- Machine-specific paths were replaced with repo-local `samples/` and `captures/` paths.
- `tools/audit_flows.py` and `tools/validate_grc.py` provide repeatable checks.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` tracks committed-file integrity.

## Flowgraphs

- `modern/lesson1.grc`
- `modern/lesson1solution.grc`

## Technical Inventory

| Flowgraph | Blocks | Connections | Key Parameters | Hardware/Audio Blocks | Transmit Blocks |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `lesson1.grc` | 16 | 9 | channel_width=200e3; channel_freq=96.5e6; center_freq=97.9e6; samp_rate=20e6 | osmosdr_source_0 (osmosdr_source); audio_sink_0 (audio_sink) | - |
| `lesson1solution.grc` | 24 | 16 | samp_rate=4e6; center_freq=172.4e6; channel_width=200e3 | audio_sink_0 (audio_sink); osmosdr_source_0 (osmosdr_source) | - |

## Standards and Frequencies

- GNU Radio Companion target validated locally: 3.8.5.0.
- Frequency, sample-rate, and mode values are shown in the inventory table above from the actual `.grc` XML.
- Transmit-capable repositories include explicit RF safety text and keep transmit examples isolated.

## Repo-Local File Paths

- `lesson1.grc`: no explicit repo-local file paths
- `lesson1solution.grc`: no explicit repo-local file paths

## Setup Helpers

- No setup scripts needed.

Run setup helpers only if you need placeholder files for local graph loading or non-radiating tests.

## Usage Examples

```sh
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3.9 tools/validate_grc.py modern/* --report VALIDATION.md
mkdir -p generated
for f in modern/*; do /opt/local/bin/grcc -o generated "$f"; done
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Open a flowgraph interactively:

```sh
gnuradio-companion modern/<flowgraph>.grc
```

Inspect generated Python before running it. Confirm hardware, frequency, gain, sample rate, and paths every time.

## Safety

Receive-only flows. Tune only to legal receive bands for your jurisdiction.

## Audit Status

- Modern flowgraph audit: `AUDIT.md`.
- GNU Radio validation: `VALIDATION.md`.
- Generation summary: `COMPILE.md`.
- Technical review: `TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md`.

## License

No new license is asserted for the original flowgraph design lineage. Review provenance before redistribution in other projects.
